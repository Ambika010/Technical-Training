storing single value = variable is opted
storing collection of values (of same type in case of java) = array is opted
works on contiguous memory allocation
provides random access of elements stored in an array
Address = base Address + index * size : uses this formula for random access
jvm to jvm the maximum range of array varries(2^31 - 1)
ordered group of elements
array can't be resized but dynamic array or list can be resized
In terms of algorithm problems, array(1D) and strings are very similar
cache friendly
best suited for read, search, sorting operations but not suitable for frequent insertion and deletion operations

Array Types:
1. Static/Fixed Size Array
   int arr[] = new int[10];
   need to build operations(CRUD) on its own
2. Dynamic Size Array (grow and shrink at run time)
   List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
   Predefined operations(CRUD)
   default size is 10 but after 10 it grows by 50% i.e. size will be 15

CRUD : create, read, update, delete

Array Algorithms:
1. pointer approach 
      2-pointer
      3-pointer
      sliding window
      binary search
2. pre-computation approach
      prefix sum
      suffix sum
3. hashing
      hash map (key,value) pair where key is unique but values can be duplicate
      hash table
      linked hash map (order of insertion is maintained)
      tree map (sorted by key)

      arrray - second way to acheive hashing
