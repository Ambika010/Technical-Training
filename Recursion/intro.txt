loops and recursion both are used for repetiton
recursion has an advantage over loop which is 
in recursion stack is formed so we can go in both direction forward and backward(using push and pop operation)
but in loops we can move only in one direction 

when function call itself, call stack mei tab tab function push hota jayega
ek time ke baad stack full ho jayega aur stack overflow error aa jayegi

jo baar baar chalana hai usko recursion mei daal do aur jo ek baar chalana hai usko base case bna do
